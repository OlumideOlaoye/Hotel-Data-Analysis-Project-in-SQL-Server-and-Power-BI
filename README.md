# Hotel-Data-Analysis-Project-in-SQL-Server-and-Power-BI

## Overview

As a Data Analyst in the hospitality industry, I built a hotel database in SQL Server and connected it to Power BI. 

Basically, I performed analysis on the hotel dataset from the database in SQL Server, then imported it into Power BI 

for further analyses and visualizations to uncover further insights in answering some business questions.
